You may use any of the other \r\nvariables to predict with. You should create a report describing how you built \r\nyour model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of \r\nsample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You will also use your \r\nprediction model to predict 20 different test cases. \r\n\r\nProject files with R markup \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
